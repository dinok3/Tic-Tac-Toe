#HOW TO PLAY

##1.Ultimate tic-tac-toe

-Your goal is to win the big tic-tac-toe board by getting three in a row - either across, down, or diagonally - or getting a majority of the squares in a full grid. In order to earn one of the nine squares in the big board, you must win the smaller tic-tac-toe board contained within it. :facepunch:

-Your opponent's previous move determines in which board(s) you are allowed to play. For example, if your opponent chose the top right square of the center board, you would then have to choose an open square in the top right board.
:confused:
-If your opponent's previous move would force you to play in a board which has already been won, you can select any open square on the whole board.  

##2.Classic tic-tac-toe

-The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

-You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

-The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
